# ðŸŽ¸ Hum2Tabs

**Hum2Tabs** is an offline-first mobile app that converts your humming into guitar tablature in real time.

Built with **Flutter 3.29** (Dart stable) and a strong focus on architecture, testability, and portability, this solo-developed project leverages audio processing and machine learning to bridge the gap between melody and music notationâ€”without needing any external server or API.
